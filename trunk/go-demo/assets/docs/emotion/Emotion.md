# Emotion Demo

## What it does
The Emotion Demo showcases the Kairos Emotion API by giving the user four methods for analyzing human emotions in a video stream.  In each method, video data is passed to the API, which returns a JSON object with frame by frame emotional values ranging from 1 to 100.  By implementing area graphs, the data is displayed visually to the user.

## Running the App

The app is basically a single page application, which is viewed at index.html.

The Emotion API demo app is comprised of four modules:

* Example Module
* Webcam Module
* Upload Module
* URL Module

---

### Example module

An example video is presented to the user, and an analysis begins immediately upon page render. 

In order to render the analysis of the example video, you must enter a demo1_id into the app.py file.  To get an ID for the example video, run this script at your command prompt:

`curl -v -X POST -H "app_id: {your app_id}" -H "app_key: {your app_key}" http://api.kairos.com/v2/media?source=https://media.kairos.com/python-demo/videos/video_1.mp4`

This should return something similar to this:

`{"id":"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz","status_code":2,"status_message":"Analyzing"}`

Enter this id value into the demo1_id definition in the app.py file:

`demo1_id = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`

Your example video should now render an emotion analysis.

To accomplish this analysis, an AJAX script in the `emoDemoApp.js` file POSTS to the route `/emotion/send-to-api` (the routes for the demos are in the main.go file).  This route calls the Golang method `SendToApiEmotion` which makes a POST request to the `https://api.kairos.com/emotion` endpoint.  The JSON response is sent back asynchronously to the `emoDemoApp.js` object.  The postProcessingLayout() function formats the JSON response for viewing and sends the JSON data to `highchartsApp.js`.

<a name="highcharts"></a>
### Highcharts
`highchartsApp.js` compliles the response data, and creates a dataset for each emotion in the JSON response.  The script loops through these datasets, compiling the x-axis, y-axis, and toolip parameters for each emotion.  In addition, all of the emotion charts are synchronized so that the metrics can be viewed in a single tooltip.  This data is then rendered on the screen inside the `#highcharts-wrapper` div.  

![Highcharts Graph](/go-demo/assets/docs/emotion/images/graph.png?raw=true)

The colors for the indivdual emotion charts are found on the emotion.html page:
```
    highchartsApp.init({
        "colors":[
            ["#22B573"],
            ["#1175E3"],
            ["#FB623E"],
            ["#DA0059"],
            ["#752673"],
            ["#FBB03B"]
        ]
    });
```
### Video display
At the same time that the highcharts graph is created, the selected video is rendered in an HTML5 tag inside the `#selected-video` div.  

Tools are provided so that the user can play, pause or scrub the video.  

![Video Controls](/go-demo/assets/docs/emotion/images/video_controls.png?raw=true)

These video functions are found in the `videoPlayer.js` object.  When any of these interactions are detected, a white curtain moves across the highcharts graph, showing the user where on the graph the video is currently playing.

### Feature Points
49 facial feature points are identified in the analysis, and these points are returned in the JSON object by adding landmarks=1 to the URL used for posting to the API.  The postProcessingLayout() function sends the JSON data with the feature points to `featurePointAnimation.js` where they are drawn on a Canvas panel which is positioned over the top of the video or image.  As the video plays, these feature points animate with the video. 

![Feature Points](/go-demo/assets/docs/emotion/images/feature_points.png?raw=true)

## JSON display

The JSON object for each of the modules is displayed when the API response is received.  
![JSON Display](/go-demo/assets/docs/emotion/images/json_display.png?raw=true)

The name/value pairs in the JSON object are color-coded using the syntaxHighlight() function in `detectDemoApp.js`.  The colors are set in emotion.css (`#json-container` response blocks).  A COPY button is provided, which allows the user to copy the JSON response to the clipboard.

---
#### Webcam Module
The webcam module uses the built-in web camera on the user's device.  A 10 second video is captured from the webcam, is sent to the Kairos API, and an emotional analysis of the video is returned.

The process is initiated by clicking WEBCAM link is clicked, which starts a 10 second webcam capture.  The app counts down from 10 until 1, when the capture is complete.

![Webcam Capture](/go-demo/assets/docs/emotion/images/webcam_capture.png?raw=true)

When the WEBCAM button is clicked, the captureUserMedia() function in the `emoDemoApp.js` object is called, which engages the getUserMedia API.  On success, a callback function (`onMediaSuccess`) is fired, which contains the video stream from the webcam.  Subsequently, the `webcamVideo` variable is set, which references the HTML5 `#webcam-video` tag, and its source is set to this video stream.  After the play() function is applied to `webcamVideo`, a mediaRecorder object is instantiated, leveraging the methods inside `MediaStreamRecorder.js`. On mediaRecorder.start(), the webcam capture begins.  When the creation of the BLOB object containing the video is complete, processVideo() is called in `emoDemoApp.js`.  The data is posted to the route `/emotion/send-to-api`, calling the Golang method `SendToApiEmotion`.  A webm file is written to assets/tmp/emotion/ with converted base64 data. A POST request is made to the Kairos API, using the following endpoint:
`https://api.kairos.com/v2/media?landmarks=1`

The payload is the webm file created above. 
``` 
{"source":"/assets/tmp/emotion/test.webm"}
```
After a response is received, this file is deleted.

<a name="polling"></a>
### Polling the API
If a successful reponse is received from the POST request to the Kairos API, it takes the following form:
```
{
    "id": "{media_id}",
    "status_code": "1",
    "status_message": "In Progress"
}
```
At this point, the analysis of the emotional data in the video is still in progress.  In order to retrieve the completed analysis, the pollApi() function in `emoDemoApp.js` is used. Using AJAX, a POST containing the media ID is sent at regular intervals again to `SendToApiEmotion` which makes a GET request to the endpoint 'https://api.kairos.com/v2/media/{mediaId}' until one of the following responses is received:
* "status_code": 4,  "status_message": "Complete", or
* "status_code": 3,  "status_message": "Failed", or
* the polling function times out.  

A message is rendered to the user if pollApi() receives status_code 3 or if a timeout is reached.

Otherwise, the postProcessingLayout() function sends the JSON data to `highchartsApp.js`. 

See [Highcharts](#highcharts)

In addition, when a status_code 3 is received, a request to the 'https://api.kairos.com/v2/analytics' endpoint is made to retrieve gender and age data.

The corresponding JSON display is also rendered.

See [JSON display](#json-display)

### Upload Module

Clicking the UPLOAD link opens the upload dialog on the user's local system.

![Upload Dialog](/go-demo/assets/docs/emotion/images/upload_dialog.png?raw=true)

The `FormData()` interface is used in 'emoDemoApp.js' to construct a key/value pair of the form field data which is posted to the route `/emotion/send-to-api`, calling the Golang method `SendToApiEmotion`.  Similar to the webcam module, a video file is written to assets/tmp/emotion/ with converted base64 data. A POST request is made to the Kairos API `https://api.kairos.com/v2/media?landmarks=1` endpoint, which contains a payload with this file:
``` 
{"source":"/assets/tmp/emotion/[uploaded video file]"}
```
Upon success, the API is then polled for a response, using the Media ID from this post request.

See [Polling](#polling)

When a response is received, the postProcessingLayout() function sends the JSON data to `highchartsApp.js`. 

See [Highcharts](#highcharts)

In addition, a request to the 'https://api.kairos.com/v2/analytics' endpoint is made to retrieve gender and age data.

The corresponding JSON display is also rendered.

See [JSON display](#json-display)
---

### URL Module

The URL of a video on the web can be entered for analysis.

![URL from the Web](/go-demo/assets/docs/emotion/images/url_from_the_web.png?raw=true)

First, the URL string is posted to the Golang method `SendToApiEmotion` where the type and length is verified.  Once they are verified, the URL string is again posted to `SendToApiEmotion` where a call to the Kairos API endpoint `https://api.kairos.com/v2/media?source=[URL String]`.


As in the other modules, the API is then polled for a response, using the Media ID from this post request.

See [Polling](#polling)

When a response is received, the postProcessingLayout() function sends the JSON data to `highchartsApp.js`. 

See [Highcharts](#highcharts)

A request to the 'https://api.kairos.com/v2/analytics' endpoint is also made to retrieve gender and age data.

The corresponding JSON display is also rendered.

See [JSON display](#json-display)

## User Interactions

The functionality for a number of user interactions is contained within the `emotionUi.js` file.  Among them are:

* Functionality for Copy to Clipboard button
* Webcam button functionality
* Upload functionality
* URL from web functionality

---

## Option Panel

If `?option-panel=yes` is added to the URL of the demo, a panel is revealed underneath the example video containing a slider/input box where the user can enter the time allowed for the demo to poll for a response once a Media ID is returned (in seconds).  See the docs for detailed information on these arguments: http://kairos.com/docs/api/
