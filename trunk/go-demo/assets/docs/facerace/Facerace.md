## What it does
The FaceRace Demo demonstrates the capability of the Kairos Face Recognition API to detect ethnicity in faces.

The developer must provide a Facebook App ID, which is entered on the index.php page:

        window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
            FB.init({
              appId      :'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
              xfbml      : true,
              version    : 'v2.8'
            });
            FB.AppEvents.logPageView();
        };
A meta tag with this App ID may also be added:
`<meta property="fb:app_id" content="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" />`

The developer can also provide a preview image, otherwise, it defaults to `demo-elizabeth.png`:
```
    if os.Getenv("DEMO_PREVIEW_IMAGE") == "" {
    demo_preview_image = "https://media.kairos.com/demo/facerace/demo-elizabeth.png"
  }
```

## Running the App

The app is basically a single page application, which is viewed at index.html.

## Upload

Clicking the UPLOAD link opens the upload dialog on the user's local system.

![Upload Dialog](/go-demo/assets/docs/facerace/images/upload_dialog.png?raw=true)

When a file is selected, Canvas is used to retrieve the image data.  This data is posted to `facerace.php` via AJAX, where a PHP cURL POST request is made to the Kairos API with the uploaded file, using the https://api.kairos.com/detect endpoint.  This file also instantiates DiversityRecognition, which handles S3 image processing and creates a graph with ethnicity data from the API response.

The end result is an image containing a "racerace" display:

## User Interactions

The functionality for a number of user interactions is contained within the `faceraceUi.js` file, which provides methods for image upload, displaying the preview image, and for handling Facebook and Twitter feeds.

---

## Social Media

The uploaded image and ethnicity metrics are saved as an image on S3 and can be shared on Facebook and Twitter.

## Dependencies
Javascript ibraries hosted by content delivery networks:
* jquery.js
* jquery-ui.js
* bootstrap.js

Note: These dependencies can be also be saved locally.

The following javascript libraries are stored locally:

* exif.js - used to retrieve orientation data from images (used in utils.js for image uploads)

The following custom javascript libraries are used:
* detectDemoApp.js - javascript object responsible for primary app functionality
* detectUi.js - a collection of javascript methods to enable user interactions
* utils.js - a collection of javascript methods for global use (canvas drawing, exif data, URL and JSON validation, aspect ratio calculations, retrival of data from image, mimetype checking, image rotation, and others)
