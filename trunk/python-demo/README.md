# Kairos Python/Javascript Demo Modules

## What it does
These demo apps showcase the Kairos APIs by giving the user a means to quickly get up and running with our Emotion Analysis and Facial Recognition / Detection APIs.

## Running the App

The app is basically a single page application, which is viewed at index.html.

The easiest way to get started is to clone or fork the repo, and add your environment, API URL, APP_ID, and API_KEY to the app.py file after signing up at [developer.kairos.com](https://developer.kairos.com) 

    demo_env = "dev, stage, or prod"
    api_url = "https://api-dev.kairos.com or https://api.kairos.com"
    app_id = "your-app-id"
    app_key = "your-app-key"

The webcam functionality requires that your site is secure (https).  In order to run your local install using https, you will need to generate a certificate and a key.  To to this, run this command:

```openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365```

Follow the prompts, and this will generate two files: `cert.pem` and `key.pem`.  These files are used so that the app will spin up a secure browser.  If you want to run in ssl, use this script in the `app.py` file:

`if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True,host='0.0.0.0',ssl_context=('cert.pem', 'key.pem'))`

 Otherwise, use this script to run non-ssl:

 `if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run(debug=True,host='0.0.0.0')`

### Run the app locally from your command prompt 
* make sure Python 2.7 is installed and accessible
* if PIP is not installed: `sudo easy_install pip`
* cd into the python-demo repo
* run `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
* run `python app.py`
* point your browser to `https://0.0.0.1:5000`

### Detect 
The Detect Demo uses Kairos Face Recognition API to detect a human face in an existing photo, or a snapshot from the user's webcam.

### Emotion
The Emotion Demo showcases the Kairos Emotion API by giving the user three methods for analyzing human emotions in a video stream.
